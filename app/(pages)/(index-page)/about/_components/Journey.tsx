      <p>
        Throughout my childhood, I turned my ideas into reality through drawing
        and building furniture for my dolls. My expansive imagination naturally
        elected me as the consultant for creative problem solving, from
        designing all of my relative's birthday cards to choosing the paint
        color of my dad's motorcycles.
        <br></br> <br></br>I further fueled my creative endeavors at Design Tech
        High School where I had the opportunity to thrive in a project-based
        curriculum modeled after Stanford University's d.school. This sparked a
        passion for the intersection of human-centered design and technology,
        and opened up a whole new world where I could continue to approach
        problems with a creative and empathetic mindset.
